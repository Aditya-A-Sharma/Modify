# Modify
Trying to enhance the functionality of the face swapping 'roop' project from @s0md3v via some python magic.

Kindly note, do not misuse this, do not swap faces without their consent, do not do to others what you wouldn't wanna be done to you or your loved ones. 

Features:
- Simple easy to understand UI.
- Process all files within a directory.
- No save dialogue boxes, all processed files are saved in the target files folder by default.
- Output files are renamed as Video_Face.mp4.
- Script checks if the video has already been processed and if the output file with same name exists it skips that file.

Future features to be added:
- Option to enable or disable gpu acceleration. (Script is slower without gpu but far more likely to run without errors).
- Install button to run anoher script which will install roop from @s0md3v is not found.
- Output directory option, which will overwrite the default of saving the processed file in the target video directory. (If requested by some user)

Screenshots:

Simple mode : Just drop the modify.py file in the roop directory and you are good to go.

Advanced mode : If you have multiple versions or forks of roop, you can use this mode to select the venv activation file and the run.py.
